## Project Description
Created an interactive website allowing users to explore the health indicators most significant to the heart, mind, and even financial health. 

## Project Details
• Leveraged three datasets from Kaggle.com which reflected predictors like smoking, blood pressure, and relationship status and how they contribute to heart disease, stroke, and medical cost.

• Utilized Flask, D3,  JavaScript, HTML/CSS and Tableau to create an interactive dashboard full of visuals regarding the different health indicators that play a large role in heart, mind and financial health.

• Used knowledge of Machine Learning to deploy a logistic regression algorithm with use of the pickle library to return a prediction of users' likelihood of having a stroke.

• Hosted and published our dashboard on Heroku cloud platform.
